      Hi! I am Katie Barr, a current art student and multi-media artist. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To me, creating art is one of the most vital things in my life. Whether it be in the margins of my notes, in a sketchbook, or drawn into my desk, I, like many other artists, am itching to create something. While I donâ€™t consider myself to be proficient in any specific field, I enjoy exploring many mediums and medias. So, though digital art is a new territory for me, it has been exciting and fun to explore.  I previously have worked mainly in traditional mediums, particularly painting and drawing, but have found new interest in exploring digital art as well as returning to photography and videography, which I previously did a lot of. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My art is inspired by my personal life and loved ones, the nature and environment around me, and cartoon and animation art styles. Animation styles are very inspiring to me, and I am often inspired by the character designs and coloring styles of various animations. (I remember when <em>Ponyo</em> came out I would ask for the concept art book for it for it, and now I am pursuing art and considering following a career path into concept art.)  My love for animation has pushed me to explore vibrant and representational colors and dynamic poses. Animation being an important part of my art-inspiration and life as a whole is what sparked and sustained my interest in art from a younger age to now.
    </p>
    <p>In painting, my subjects are typically more personal, being my family and loved ones, and close-personal subject matters. I have been more recently inspired by surrealist art as well, creating pieces that are based more in the subconscious and dream-like aspects of the mind. The colors and other-worldly-like atmosphere of surrealism have inspired my own representations of the world in my art. I have used this to tackle person subject matter in my works and show how my mind perceives the world. </p>
